  <p>
    Python is a cross-platform, high-level programming language. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.

  <code>
    # Example code
    print("Hello, Python!")
  </code>

            <p>
                Before diving into Python, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some experience with another programming language. Familiarity with concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals will make it easier to grasp Python's syntax and features. Additionally, knowledge of the command line interface and how to run scripts will be beneficial for executing Python programs.

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header> Hello World </header>
            <p>
                The "Hello World" program is often the first program you write when learning a new programming language. In Python, it is as simple as printing a string:

                <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>

                This code will output the string "Hello, World!" to the console. It serves as a basic introduction to the syntax and structure of a Python program.

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <header> Data Types </header>
            <p>
                Python supports several built-in data types, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers: Integers and floating-point numbers</li>
                    <li>Strings: Sequences of characters</li>
                    <li>Booleans: True or False</li>
                    <li>Lists: Ordered collections of items</li>
                    <li>Tuples: Immutable ordered collections of items</li>
                    <li>Dictionaries: Key-value pairs</li>
                    <li>Sets: Unordered collections of unique items</li>
                </ul>
                Understanding these data types and how to work with them is essential for writing Python programs.

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header> Variables </header>
            <p>
                In Python, variables are used to store values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit variable declaration. You can simply assign a value to a variable and start using it. For example:

                <code>x = 42</code>

                In this case, the variable "x" is assigned the value 42. Python determines the type of the variable based on the assigned value. Variables can be reassigned to different values, and their types can change dynamically during the execution of a program.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header> If...else Statement </header>
            <p>
                The if...else statement allows you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. It follows this syntax:

                <code>if condition:
    statement_1
else:
    statement_2</code>

                The condition is an expression that evaluates to either True or False. If the condition is True, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. You can also use the elif keyword to specify additional conditions to check. Here's an example:

                <code>if condition_1:
    statement_1
elif condition_2:
    statement_2
else:
    statement_3</code>

                In this case, if condition_1 is True, statement_1 is executed. If condition_1 is False and condition_2 is True, statement_2 is executed. If both conditions are False, statement_3 is executed.
